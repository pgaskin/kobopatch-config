Set slide to unlock:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Swipe to unlock is enabled by default for the Kobo Forma. This patch allows
      you to enable/disable swipe to unlock for any device.
  # In the subroutine where the AbstractPowerView (used for swipe to unlock) is instantiated:
  # pre-4.11.12111: change Device::isFrost() to a MOV instruction to set true/false
  # 4.11.12111+: change PowerSettings::getUnlockEnabled() (to override the hidden config setting [PowerSettings] -> UnlockEnabled)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xA15340, FindBLX: 0x4419D0, ReplaceH: 4F F0 01 00}

Enable rotation on all devices:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Enables rotation on all devices. This shows a rotation icon in the status
      bar, which shows a menu allowing you to choose between portrait and landscape
      when pressed. This icon is only shown on rotateable views (like the reader).
  # This patch is not necessary anymore since 4.13.12638, as there is a fully
  # working config setting (ForceAllowLandscape in the DeveloperSettings section)
  # now, but is being kept for backwards compatibility with old kobopatch configs
  # and for convenience.
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0x67D576, FindBLX: 0x419860, ReplaceH: 4F F0 01 00}

  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xA1E890, FindH: 2E B1}

Both page turn sides go next:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Make both page turn sides go next in the reader.
  # In ReadingView::processTap(TapGesture*):
  # nop the branch for checking if left-to-right (so it always runs the swap of back/forward)
  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xA25AE0, FindH: 18 B9}
  # where r3 = *(r7+0xc) (back) and r2 = *(r7+0x18) (forward), then they are stored in reverse,
  # instead of storing each one, just store forward (by changing the source register in the str
  # instruction)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xA25AE6, FindH: BB 61, ReplaceH: BA 61}
  # This patch could have also been done later on where the tap point is checked against different
  # QRects, but that's a lot more complicated due to the use of QHash s of pointers to functions.

Disable all tutorial dialogs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Removes the annoying tutorials (and recurring dialogs). Note - I may
      have missed a few of them. If I have, just open an issue on GitHub or
      PM me (geek1011) on MobileRead, and I'll fix it.
  # 0x419860 is the offset of QVariant::toBool, which is called after getting
  # the setting (of if it has/should show) as a QVariant. I am replacing this
  # method as opposed to replacing the return value of the function for 1. A
  # MOV instruction with an immediate (fixed) value is 4 long (rather than 2)
  # and 2. This is simpler to update as I only need to update the function
  # offset and the offset for each setting.

Custom font sizes:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Changes the range of sizes on the font size slider so that there are more of
      the small sizes and fewer of the large sizes.
      With this patch enabled you will not be able to select the very large font
      sizes, but will be able to make finer adjustment to the smaller sizes.
    # Font sizes depend on the device's screen resolution. Unpatched, the sizes
    # increase in steps of 1 from the smallest size up to size 22, then in steps
    # of 2 up to size 50, then in steps of 4 up to the largest size:

ePub fixed/adjustable top/bottom margins:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: ePub padding-bottom alternatives
  - Description: |
      This patch sets the @page margin sizes in epubs, overriding any @page margin
      set in the book's CSS stylesheet (but not in the XPGT stylesheet, see below).
      
      By default the top and bottom margins are set to be adjustable, their size
      similar to the left/right margin size set by the adjustment slider. There
      are options to set the top and/or bottom margin to a fixed size instead.
      
      Note that @page margins are seperate from (and overlap) both the body margins
      set in the book and the left/right margins set from the adjustment slider,
      and are added to any page margins set in the Adobe XPGT stylesheet if the
      book has one (e.g. page-template.xpgt). For this reason you might want to
      consider using the Modify ePub Calibre plugin to remove any body margins and
      XPGT stylesheet margins before sideloading the book, or perhaps enabling the
      `Ignore ePub Adobe XPGT stylesheet (page-template.xpgt)` patch.
      
      Also note that a side-effect of this patch is that the body padding-bottom is
      removed from the built-in stylesheet, which means that there will no longer
      be a blank line added automatically at the end of chapters.
      
      See at the bottom of the patch for replacement values that can be used to
      tune the size of the margins to suit different devices and reading modes.

ePub disable built-in body padding-bottom:

      THIS PATCH COULD RESULT IN A BOOT LOOP when signing out of your Kobo account
      (Settings > Accounts > Sign out) or when invoking a factory reset from the
      device information menu (Settings > Device information > Factory reset).
      REMOVE THIS PATCH BEFORE USING EITHER OF THOSE OPTIONS.
      A factory reset invoked using the hardware methods (such as holding down the
      light button while switching on) should not be affected.

Set KePub hyphenation:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      The built-in KePub stylesheet has a line * { -webkit-hyphens: auto; }
      to turn on hyphenation, but it is only used if the device's justification
      button is set to full justification. With this patch enabled hyphenation
      will always be turned on, regardless of justification button setting.
      
      (The publisher can still turn hyphenation off/on in the book's stylesheet.)

Fix three KePub fullScreenReading bugs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: See http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=3113460&postcount=16
    ## This patch may not be needed anymore since firmware 4.11.11911, as there is now
    ## an officially supported option to disable headers and footers, which doesn't seem
    ## to have this bug.
    ##
    ## In full-screen reading mode (when the FullScreenReading feature setting is
    ## activated and the "Show header and footer" reading setting is unticked) the
    ## KePub reader has three problems:
    ##
    ## 1. If the book's stylesheet has non-zero body margin/padding, then the
    ##    text is shifted to the right and can be cut off at the right margin.
    ## 2. Characters with large side bearing values (such as italic f, J) can
    ##    be cut off if they appear at either end of a line.
    ## 3. Images which are supposed to be displayed inline (flowing with the text)
    ##    are instead displayed centred in a seperate block.
    ##
    ## This patch fixes those problems by replacing the following faulty style,
    ## which is the cause of problem 3.:
    ##
    ##   img {
    ##     display: block;
    ##     margin-left: auto !important;
    ##     margin-right: auto !important;
    ##     width: auto !important;
    ##     height: auto !important;
    ##   }
    ##
    ## with the following two styles, which work around problems 1. and 2.:
    ##
    ##   body {
    ##     margin: 0 !important;
    ##     padding: 0 !important;
    ##   }
    ##
    ##   body>div {
    ##     padding-left: 0.2em !important;
    ##     padding-right: 0.2em !important;
    ##   }

Force user line spacing in KePubs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This patch will allow the line spacing set by the slider to take effect
      in some problem KePub books with fixed linespacing (including ones where the
      publisher has used <div> instead of <p> for paragraphs, or wrapped each
      paragraph in a <span> and set the line-height on the span.) However it might
      also override some line spacing that would better be left fixed, e.g. it can
      cause problems with the spacing of paragraphs that begin with a raise-cap.
    # body, p { line-height: %1 ... }  -->  body *  { line-height: %1 ... }
  - FindBaseAddressString: "body, p { line-height: %1"

    #
    # Option: Comment out the replace_string line above and uncomment the one below
    # for a less forceful version of this patch that has fewer side effects and
    # should still work for most problem books, but not the ones where the publisher
    # has set the line-height at <span> level.

      This patch prevents any font-family style set in the book's stylesheet from
      being recognised. It might spoil the style of books which use multiple fonts,
      but will ensure that the font-family set from the device menu takes effect.

Un-Force user font-family in KePubs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      The KePub reader uses a very heavy-handed method of setting the font selected
      by the user, overriding all fonts set by the publisher in the book unless
      "Publisher Default" is selected.
      This patch lets the font-family set by the publisher in the KePub stylesheet
      override the font-family selected by the reader from the device in some
      cases, which allows a mix of user-selected and publisher-selected fonts.
      Alternatives 1-3 give increasing preference to the publisher-selected fonts.

# The following patch(es) are ported from jackie_w's patches
Dictionary text font-family/font-size/line-height - beta:
  - Enabled: no
    # This patch allows you to to customise the appearance of the text 
    # in the dictionary pop-up widget and full-screen dictionary page.
    #
    # You can change one or more of the following attributes:
    #   - font-family
    #   - font-size
    #   - line-height
    #
    # Stage 1: Change DictionaryView to remove %1, %2 etc variables
    #   from:
    #       * { font: %1px %2; line-height: %5em; }
    #       div.descriptionFont { font-family: %3; }
    #       ol { font-size: %1px; font-weight: bold; margin-left: %4em; margin-top: 0px; }

    # ##### N.B. Do not change anything above this line #####

    #
    # Stage 2: N.B. You MUST keep old and new strings EXACTLY the same length
    #
    # Un-comment ONE ONLY of the following replace_string examples 
    #   to change dictionary font-family from default Georgia:
    #   - to a different built-in font
    #   - to one of your sideloaded custom fonts
    #
    # Notes for changing font-family:
    #   1.  Pad the shorter of the old/new strings with spaces to 
    #       keep same length for both strings (see examples below)
    #
    #   2.  If the new font-family name (max. 50 chars) contains any spaces it must be
    #       wrapped in "double-quotes" (see examples 2, 3)
    #
    #   3.  To change from Georgia to the Kobo default sans-serif font, Avenir, 
    #       use either one of the following to achieve the same result:
    #       - sans-serif
    #       - "Avenir Next Medium"
    # 
    # Examples for customising font-family:
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x36, Find: "Georgia   ", Replace: "sans-serif", MustMatchLength: yes}
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x36, Find: "Georgia    ", Replace: "\"Gill Sans\"", MustMatchLength: yes}
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x36, Find: "Georgia      ", Replace: "\"Kobo Nickel\"", MustMatchLength: yes}
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x36, Find: "Georgia ", Replace: "Bookerly", MustMatchLength: yes}
    #
    # Un-comment and edit next line to change font-size
# - ReplaceString: {Offset: 0x0F, Find: "40px", Replace: "30px", MustMatchLength: yes}
