# The following patch(es) are by geek1011

Rename new home screen footer:
  - Enabled: no
  # This patch happens use shared strings in most versions, and may cause unusual
  # replacements in other parts of the GUI (see https://github.com/geek1011/kobopatch-patches/issues/34).
  # This isn't usually an issue (and changes between versions), but occasionally,
  # the keyboard uses a letter from one of these strings, and will type the letter
  # from the replacement.
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "Find your next great read", Replace: "Find your next great read"}
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "Buy, borrow, or preview books", Replace: "Buy, borrow, or preview books"}
  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "Find your next book in Kobo Plus or our store", Replace: "Find your next book in Kobo Plus or our store"}
    # You can enable the following replacement, but note that it might cause the o letter on the keyboard to change
#  - FindReplaceString: {Find: "Shop Kobo", Replace: "9char-str"}

Both page turn buttons go next:
  - Enabled: no

  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xAD2824, FindH: 28 B9, ReplaceH: 05 E0} # CBNZ R0, #0xE -> B #0xE

Both page turn sides go next:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: Make both page turn sides go next in the reader.
  # In ReadingView::processTap(TapGesture*):
  # nop the branch for checking if left-to-right (so it always runs the swap of back/forward)
  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xADA4B6, FindH: 18 B9}
  # where r3 = *(r7+0x18) (back) and r2 = *(r7+0x20) (forward), then they are stored in reverse,
  # instead of storing each one, just store forward (by changing the source register in the str
  # instruction)
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xADA4BC, FindH: 3B 62, ReplaceH: 3A 62}
  # This patch could have also been done later on where the tap point is checked against different
  # QRects, but that's a lot more complicated due to the use of QHash s of pointers to functions.

Replace adobe page numbers toggle with invert screen:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |

      screen one.

Disable all tutorial dialogs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Removes the annoying tutorials (and recurring dialogs). Note - I may
      have missed a few of them. If I have, just open an issue on GitHub or
      PM me (geek1011) on MobileRead, and I'll fix it.
  # 0x4964CC is the offset of QVariant::toBool, which is called after getting
  # the setting (of if it has/should show) as a QVariant. I am replacing this
  # method as opposed to replacing the return value of the function for 1. A
  # MOV instruction with an immediate (fixed) value is 4 long (rather than 2)
  # and 2. This is simpler to update as I only need to update the function
  # offset and the offset for each setting.

      allows showing the info panel even when using a random screensaver image
      from .kobo/screensaver (note that full-screen covers needs to be enabled
      for the screensaver to show).
  - ReplaceBytesNOP: {Offset: 0xACA500, FindBLX: 0x4CA408}

Remove title from reading header/footer:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: Removes the chapter/book title from the new reading header/footer.
  # In the longest form of ReadingFooter::update (the others are wrappers with
  # the args being set to the current value), the first one is the title. The
  # final string is created by starting with the title, then appending the "-",
  # then the page number / percentage / etc text.
  #
  # This one is slightly unusual in that the reading header also shares the
  # ReadingFooter code (ReadingView::updateProgressHeader only has the page text,
  # and it ends with a branch to ReadingFooter::update). This means we only have
  # to patch one place, but it also means you can't have the title in one, but
  # not the other.
  #
  # We'll patch this in a slightly hacky and inefficient, but simple and easy-to-update
  # way by replacing the first QString::append (the dash) with a QString::resize
  # to zero (I would have done a QString::clear, but that symbol isn't imported):
  - ReplaceBytes: {Offset: 0xC1204E, FindH: F9 68, ReplaceH: 00 21} # replace LDR r1, [...] with MOV r1, #0 (the LDR doesn't matter, but will need to be updated)

Larger Sleep/Power-off timeouts:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: Sleep/Power-off timeouts
  - Description: |
      Increase the available sleep/power-off timeouts to larger values (up to a
      few weeks). To customize this patch, see https://pgaskin.net/kobopatch-patches/lgrpwroff-12920.html .

      IMPORTANT - Although this patch has been tested by multiple users and
      confirmed to be working, the interaction between the RTC timer and Nickel
      has many moving parts. As reported by JSWolf on MR, this patch might have
      issues with actually powering-off with timeouts longer than a day. The
      cause is likely to be the auto-sync interval or sleepcover causing the
      timer to be overridden/reset every day. Nevertheless, this patch should
      work reliably for timeouts under 12 hours, and probably under 1 day.

      If you are using this patch with timeouts above 12 hours, and can confirm
      if it works/doesn't work, please PM me or comment on GitHub with your
      setting values, sleepcover or not, auto-sync interval, wifi on/off, firmware
      version, and Kobo model.

Custom font sizes:
  # Updated by Semwize (https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?p=3897542) and geek1011 for 4.18.13737
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      Changes the range of sizes on the font size slider so that there are more of

      With this patch enabled you will not be able to select the very large font
      sizes, but will be able to make finer adjustment to the smaller sizes.
    # Font sizes depend on the device's screen density. Unpatched, the sizes
    # increase in steps of 1 from the smallest size up to size 22, then in steps
    # of 2 up to size 50, then in steps of 4 up to the largest size:
    #
    #  AuraOne/Forma:       18px - 194px (55 sizes)
    #  GloHD/ClaraHD/Libra: 14px - 150px (48 sizes)

    #  Glo/Aura:            12px - 122px (43 sizes)
    #  Touch/Mini:          12px - 90px  (35 sizes)
    #
    # The example replacement values in this patch result in the following ranges,
    # with increases in steps of 1 from the smallest size up to size 44, then
    # steps of 2 up to size 68, then steps of 4 up to the largest size:
    #
    #  AuraOne/Forma:       18px - 132px (55 sizes)

  - PatchGroup: ePub padding-bottom alternatives
  - Description:
      This patch sets the @page margin sizes in epubs to fixed custom values,
      overriding any @page margin set in the book's CSS stylesheet. (But beware
      that some books also set page margins in an XPGT stylesheet which are added
      to any CSS @page margins, and those will not be affected by this patch).

ePub disable built-in body padding-bottom:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: ePub padding-bottom alternatives
  - Description: |
      The built-in ePub stylesheet adds a line of padding at the bottom of the
      body element, to prevent the chapter ending on the last line of a page.
      This patch disables that stylesheet entry.
      
      This patch is not compatible with `ePub fixed/adjustable top/bottom margins`
      patch, which already removes this stylesheet entry to make room for other
      things.

Block WiFi firmware upgrade:
  - Enabled: no
  - PatchGroup: Firmware upgrade options
  - Description: |
      WARNING! THIS IS A DANGEROUS PATCH! READ THE INFORMATION BELOW CAREFULLY!
      
      THIS PATCH IS UNTESTED, as there is no way to be sure it still works until
      the next firmware version is released. If it works then the firmware will
      not be upgraded during a WiFi sync, but you will still be able to upgrade
      manually or by syncing with the Kobo desktop.
      
      THIS PATCH COULD RESULT IN A BOOT LOOP when signing out of your Kobo account
      (Settings > Accounts > Sign out) or when invoking a factory reset from the
      device information menu (Settings > Device information > Factory reset).
      REMOVE THIS PATCH BEFORE USING EITHER OF THOSE OPTIONS.
      A factory reset invoked using the hardware methods (such as holding down the
      light button while switching on) should not be affected.

Set KePub hyphenation:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      The built-in KePub stylesheet has a line * { -webkit-hyphens: auto; }
      to turn on hyphenation, but it is only used if the device's justification
      button is set to full justification. With this patch enabled hyphenation
      will always be turned on, regardless of justification button setting.

Force user line spacing in KePubs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      This patch will allow the line spacing set by the slider to take effect
      in some problem KePub books with fixed linespacing (including ones where the
      publisher has used <div> instead of <p> for paragraphs, or wrapped each
      paragraph in a <span> and set the line-height on the span.) However it might
      also override some line spacing that would better be left fixed, e.g. it can
      cause problems with the spacing of paragraphs that begin with a raise-cap.
    # body, p { line-height: %1 ... }  -->  body *  { line-height: %1 ... }
  - FindBaseAddressString: "body, p { line-height: %1"
  - ReplaceString: {Find: "body, p {", Replace: "body *  {", MustMatchLength: yes}
    #
    # Option: Comment out the replace_string line above and uncomment the one below
    # for a less forceful version of this patch that has fewer side effects and
    # should still work for most problem books, but not the ones where the publisher
    # has set the line-height at <span> level.
    #
    # body, p { line-height: %1 ... }  -->  body,div,p{line-height:%1 ... }

Un-Force user font-family in KePubs:
  - Enabled: no
  - Description: |
      The KePub reader uses a very heavy-handed method of setting the font selected
      by the user, overriding all fonts set by the publisher in the book unless
      "Publisher Default" is selected.
      This patch lets the font-family set by the publisher in the KePub stylesheet
      override the font-family selected by the reader from the device in some
      cases, which allows a mix of user-selected and publisher-selected fonts.
      Alternatives 1-3 give increasing preference to the publisher-selected fonts.
