#Show series name in grid:

#
#  # When updating the series for the SeriesGridWidget:
#  - BaseAddress: "SeriesGridWidget::setContent(Series const&)"

#  # NOP Series::booksCount since we don't need its value anymore and we want to

#  # Then, instead of calling tr, we can get the series name. We could use
#  # Series::title, but that just calls Content::getTitleRaw, which returns a
#  # QByteArray (most functions dereference it [remember that the first thing in
#  # a QByteArray is the data pointer] to get a const char*), which isn't exactly
#  # what we need. Instead, we call Content::getTitle, which returns a QString:

#      ReplaceInstBLX: {SymPLT: "Content::getTitle() const"}
#
#  # But, since it returns a QString on the stack, we need to pass a pointer to
#  # the stack memory for it as a hidden argument before the others, making r0
#  # the return value pointer and r1 the Series this pointer (it was originally
#  # in r4 for tr to return it's value) (see the ARM and Itanium C++ ABIs) (see
#  # https://godbolt.org/z/1vnM3e) (also note that the values of r0 and r1 aren't
#  # used by anything after this, so we don't need to bother preserving them):
#  - ReplaceBytes:
#      Offset:   158   # note: it's important that this is before the r0=r4, since we still need the r0 to have the Series this pointer
#      FindH:    7A 44 # add r2, pc
#      ReplaceH: 01 46 # mov r1, r0 (set the second argument to the Series* this pointer)
#  - ReplaceBytes:
#      Offset:   160
#      FindH:    20 46 # mov r0, r4 (the r4 is irrelevant, as it's just what was used to store the pointer - it's the r0 that matters since it's the hidden first argument for the stack pointer for the QString return value)
#      CheckOnly: true # it's already done for use with the tr function
#
#  # Just to make sure it's used to set the QLabel's text:
#  - ReplaceBytes:
#      Offset:    168
#      FindH:     21 46 # mov r1, r4
